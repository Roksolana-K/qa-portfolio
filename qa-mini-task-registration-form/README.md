## Notes for Portfolio Version

- All company-specific details have been anonymized.
- The form URL is replaced with `[redacted]`.

- Screenshots and bug reports are my own work.

## Restrospective

- The initial assignment and its original submission differ from the current portfolio version.
- I worked on the mistakes and expanded the scope of checks, paying more attention to detail.
- There is still room for growth:
  - improove my understanding of JavaScript errors and form-backend interaction;
  - learning to develop a checklist and a test plan before testing;
  - improove my sysematic approach to exploratory testing;

This project in my portfolio shows how I can review previous work, draw conclusions, and improve it.
