# ðŸ‘€ Site Decomposition

**About the task**  
This is a course assignment I completed as part of a Manual QA program.    
The goal was to analyze the [Conduit app](https://conduit.mate.academy/) from a logged-in userâ€™s perspective and break it down into pages, components, states, and basic flows.


**What I did**  
- Registered a new user, created an article, and posted a comment  
- Explored the app for ~15â€“20 minutes to understand core functionality  
- Decomposed key pages and noted states
